<h3>DAY 1 : Jul 7 , 2018</h3>

<b>Today's Progress :</b> Completed a course "Intro to python for DataScience" on datacamp, focused on the numpy package, 
Also a coding assignment of the course "neural networks and deep learning".
Learnt several key numpy functions.

<h3>DAY 2 : Jul 8 , 2018</h3>

<b>Today's Progress :</b> learnt about the matplotlib and data visualization. built various types of plots and customized them as an assignment on a datacamp course. Started with some Machine learning algorithms. learnt about logistic regression and neural network. Spent time understanding the algorithms. Also studied about vectorization.

<h3>DAY 3 : Jul 9 , 2018</h3>

<b>Today's Progress :</b> Built a cat classifier as a part of coding assignment of a course. Tested it with my own image at the end. it was classifed correctly. Used Logistic regression. Learnt about and implemented parameter initialization, cost function, gradient, and optimization etc.
