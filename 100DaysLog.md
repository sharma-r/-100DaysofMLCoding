<h3>DAY 1 : Jul 7 , 2018</h3>

<b>Today's Progress :</b> Completed a course "Intro to python for DataScience" on datacamp, focused on the numpy package, 
Also a coding assignment of the course "neural networks and deep learning".
Learnt several key numpy functions.

<h3>DAY 2 : Jul 8 , 2018</h3>

<b>Today's Progress :</b> learnt about the matplotlib and data visualization. built various types of plots and customized them as an assignment on a datacamp course. Started with some Machine learning algorithms. learnt about logistic regression and neural network. Spent time understanding the algorithms. Also studied about vectorization.

<h3>DAY 3 : Jul 9 , 2018</h3>

<b>Today's Progress :</b> Built a cat classifier as a part of coding assignment of a course. Tested it with my own image at the end. it was classifed correctly. Used Logistic regression. Learnt about and implemented parameter initialization, cost function, gradient, and optimization etc.

<h3>DAY 4 : Jul 10 , 2018</h3>

<b>Today's Progress :</b> learnt about CNN and keras. credits: @Sirajology on youtube. Built an image classsifier using keras and tensorflow.

<h3>DAY 5 : Jul 11 , 2018</h3>

<b>Today's Progress :</b> Built a shallow neural network with one hidden layer, using forward propagation and backpropagation.
learnt about and implemented hidden units and hidden layers, various activation functions, random initialization. Built a program that generates red and blue points to form a flower, and then fit a neural network to classify those points.Also tested with different parameters to observe performance in different cases.

<h3>DAY 6 : Jul 12 , 2018</h3>

<b>Today's Progress :</b> learnt about the key computations underlying deep learning, analyzing matrix and vector dimensions, foraward backward propagation, and understood the roles of hyperparameters in deep learning.

<h3>DAY 7 : Jul 13 , 2018</h3>

<b>Today's Progress :</b> Use deep learning to build and train deep neural networks. Built an image classifier using deep neural networks which calssifies with greater accuracy as compared to logistic regression implemented previously. Completed the course "Neural networks and Deep Learning."
